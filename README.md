Use a 2-link planar robot manipulator with horizontal axes and draw on the vertical plane the first letter of my name. 
Simulate the joint torques through the motion and present the following torque profiles.

1. Inertial torque of each joint due to its own inertia
2. Coupled torque
3. Centripetal torque
4. Coriolis torque
5. Gravity torque
